            My name is Ethan Kennedy.
            My fitness journey hasn't been defined by a single lane, 
            but by a relentless curiosity for human movement. 
            I believe the best way to lead is by example, 
            which is why I’ve spent years acting as my own test subject. 
            Over the last four years, I have immersed myself in the discipline 
            of Bodybuilding and Powerlifting, the agility of Calisthenics, 
            and the mindfulness of Yoga. Applying everything I learn in the gym 
            to combat sports such as Brazilian Jujitsu and Kickboxing. 
            I believe in learning and trying new things in the gym often to 
            broaden your skills and knowledge.
